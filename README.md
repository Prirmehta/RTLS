# Historical Movement & Zone Analytics Dashboard
A React-based dashboard visualises the past movement of assets in warehouse environments. It has extended traditional RTLS capabilities with a post-event spatiotemporal analytics layer, which enables heatmaps, trajectory intelligence and behaviour-based zone optimisation.

# Tools & Technologies Used 
This project is focused solely on the front-end development of a historical asset trail dashboard and is built with React + TypeScript using Vite for fast builds. The asset trails and heatmaps were displayed with interactive React icons and Bootstrap for a responsive layout. 

The dashboard includes two main views: 
1. Action Trail View: It shows past asset movement 
2. Heatmap View: It displays zone activity based on selected metrics 

# Colour Combinations Used
The dashboard maintains a clean, professional look with a subtle white and grey light mode for a sharp, corporate feel. Assets are distinctly color-coded for clarity, and controls like Play, Pause, and Reset follow standard color conventions. Inspired by Phantom, the dark mode uses cool tones and vibrant accents, blending a modern, creative aesthetic with practical usability.
